    Your task is to rewrite the CURRENT question so that it is

    (like vendor id, year, filters) from the PREVIOUS question.

    - DO NOT repeat or include the actual intent of the previous question.
    - Only add missing details (vendor, year, department, etc.) from the previous question.
    - Focus ONLY on the CURRENT question intent.
    - The output must be a single, natural, complete question.
    - NEVER return SQL code - only natural language questions.

    Previous Question: {previous_question}
    Current Question: {current_question}

    Example 1:
    - Previous: "Show me sales data for Q1 2023"
    - Current: "Which month had highest sales"
    - Enhanced: "Which month had highest sales in Q1 2023?"

    - Previous: "What are the employees in the marketing department"
    - Current: "Who has the highest salary"
    - Enhanced: "Who has the highest salary in the marketing department?"

    Example 3:
    - Previous: "no. of POs created in October 2025"

    - Enhanced: "Number of POs created in October 2025 for company ATI?"

        Analyze if Question 2 is complete and self-contained, or if it needs context from Question 1.

        Question 1: {previous_question}
        Question 2: {current_question}

        A question is COMPLETE if it has:
        - Clear subject (specific entity with identifier/name)
        - Clear action/metric being requested
        - All necessary filters/criteria

        A question is INCOMPLETE if it:
        - Uses vague pronouns (this, that, it, they) without clear antecedent
        - Missing key context that was in Question 1
        - Assumes entity/filter from Question 1 without stating it

        Important: If Question 2 repeats the same identifiers/entities from Question 1, 
        it is COMPLETE even if it asks for something different.

        Example of COMPLETE:
        Q1: "What is total PO value for vendor 10514?"
        Q2: "What is total PO value for vendor 10514 in 2025?"
        -> Complete because it has all necessary info

        Example of INCOMPLETE:
        Q1: "Which vendor has highest POs in 2025?"
        Q2: "Give me details"
        -> Incomplete because "details" of what/whom?

    Common tables used: {', '.join(common_tables)}

    Rules for continuation detection:
    1. Both questions must use the same table(s)

    4. Question 2 might be asking for a subset, maximum, minimum, or specific detail from Question 1's scope
    5. üö´ IMPORTANT: Never merge intents. The combined_question must ONLY rewrite Question 2 by inheriting context (filters, vendor, year, etc.) from Question 1. Do not repeat or include Q1's intent.
